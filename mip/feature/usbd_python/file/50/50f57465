# Shared constants
#
# It's a tough decision of when to make a constant "shared" like this. "Private" constants have no resource use, but these will take up flash space for the name. Suggest deciding on basis of:
#
# - Is this constant used in a lot of places, including potentially by users
#   of this package?
#
# Otherwise, it's not the greatest sin to be copy-pasting "private" constants
# in a couple of places. I guess. :/

class Buffer:
    # An interrupt-safe producer/consumer buffer that wraps a bytearray object.
    #
    # Kind of like a ring buffer, but supports the idea of returning a
    # memoryview for either read or write of multiple bytes (suitable for
    # passing to a buffer function without needing to allocate another buffer to
    # read into.)
    #
    # Consumer can call pend_read() to get a memoryview to read from, and then
    # finish_read(n) when done to indicate it read 'n' bytes from the
    # memoryview. There is also a readinto() convenience function.
    #
    # Producer must call pend_write() to get a memorybuffer to write into, and
    # then finish_write(n) when done to indicate it wrote 'n' bytes into the
    # memoryview. There is also a normal write() convenience function.
    #
    # - Only one producer and one consumer is supported.
    #
    # - Calling pend_read() and pend_write() is effectively idempotent, they can be
    #   called more than once without a corresponding finish_x() call if necessary
    #   (provided only one thread does this, as per the previous point.)
    #
    # - Calling finish_write() and finish_read() is hard interrupt safe (does
    #   not allocate). pend_read() and pend_write() each allocate 1 block for
    #   the memoryview that is returned.
    #
    # The buffer contents are always laid out as:
    #
    # - Slice [:_n] = bytes of valid data waiting to read
    # - Slice [_n:_w] = unused space
    # - Slice [_w:] = bytes of pending write buffer waiting to be written
    #
    # This buffer should be fast when most reads and writes are balanced and use
    # the whole buffer.  When this doesn't happen, performance degrades to
    # approximate a Python-based single byte ringbuffer.
